# Sensor Data Analysis with Python

Analyzing, plotting, and animating location, motion, and Bluetooth data collected by mobile devices. Experimenting with different projections and methods for calculating the distance between two positions. Fitting and plotting location data from a 400m track. Experimenting with algorithms for processing motion data to detect and count repeated patterns. Plotting and experimenting with statistical analysis of Bluetooth data.

Analyzed with [numpy](https://numpy.org/) and [scipy](https://scipy.org/). Plotted with [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).

## Setup
Environment is setup using [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).
